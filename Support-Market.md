Companies may need to rely more on automation to manage costs.</li> <li><strong>Consumer Expectations:</strong> Today's consumers demand more from businesses. Expect faster response times, personalized interactions, and omnichannel availability as key drivers for companies to invest heavily in support technologies.</li> </ul> <h2>Why the Shift Matters: Key Insights and Takeaways</h2> <p>The shift from 2018-2022 to 2023-2033 in the support market is not just about technological advancements but also about the deeper transformation of business strategies.
