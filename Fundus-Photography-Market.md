This growth trajectory will be driven by innovations in technology, increasing healthcare access, and a growing number of patients seeking early diagnosis for retinal diseases. By the end of 2033, the global market could be valued at over $X billion.</p><p>North America and Europe are expected to remain dominant markets, with substantial investments in healthcare infrastructure and advanced imaging technologies.
